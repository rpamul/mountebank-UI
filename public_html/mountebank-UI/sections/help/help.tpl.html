        Mountebank UI is a code generator for
        the <a  target='_new' href="http://www.mbtest.org">Mountebank</a> server. This program helps
        the user formulate the various sections of the JSON that is used with 
        Mountebank's API to create a test double. Source code for this application is
        located at <a href="https://github.com/donhenton/mountebank-UI">
            https://github.com/donhenton/mountebank-UI</a>.

        <div class='helpHeader'>The Home Page</div>   
        This is the page where one can set the response or multiple responses, 
        and the required criteria. This page works on the current <em>Imposter
            Collection</em> which is all the imposters for a given port. An imposter
        is a given response/match pair. New imposters can be added or deleted
        on this page as well. Additionally, one can change the sort order of 
        imposters, as Mountebank apparently uses short-circuit matching logic.

        <p><h5>Notes</h5></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently on the http protocol is supported. The use case is test
                doubles for REST services</li>
            <li>For any element in Response or Match, if left blank it will not be 
                included in the mountebank json.</li>
            <li>Query elements in match criteria use only deepEquals</li>
            <li>Method is not optional</li>
            <li>The match logic is each group (body, query parameters, headers)
                are AND'd together. Complex logic using OR is not currently 
                available</li>

    <div class="row">
        <div class='helpHeader'>Collection Maintenance Page</div>   
        This is the page where one can delete and add collections, as well as
        modify the properties
        associated with a collection, currently the description and the port.
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class='helpHeader'>Mountebank JSON Page</div>   
        This page provides a read only display of the JSON that can be posted to 
        Mountebank's imposter's endpoint. Additionally one can post directly 
        mountebank via a form. Provide the base url to mountebank, and choose the
        action, either post or delete. Note that Mountebank will need the '--allowCORS'
        option for this to work.

        <div class='helpHeader'>Persistence</div>   
        All data is persisted to local storage. If accessing this application
        for the first time, an initial collection will be created. The data can 
        be export and imported using the menu item <em>Import/Export</em>. 
        The persisted data is in a format
        which allows the creation of the Mountebank data, it is not in the 
        Mountebank format.
