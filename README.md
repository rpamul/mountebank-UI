## Summary

Mountebank UI is a test double generator for
the  [Mountebank](href="http://www.mbtest.org) server. This program helps
the user formulate the various sections of the JSON that is used with 
Mountebank's API to create a test double.

## The Home Page   
This is the page where one can set the response or multiple responses, 
and the required criteria. This page works on the current **Imposter
    Collection** which is all the imposters for a given port. An imposter
is a given response/match pair. New imposters can be added or deleted
on this page as well.

> ### Notes 
> * Http protocol only
> * For any element in Response or Match, if left blank it will not be 
    included in the mountebank json. 
> * Query elements in match criteria use only deepEquals 
> * Method is not optional 
> * The match logic is each group (body, query parameters, headers)
>     are AND'd together. Complex logic using OR is not currently 
>     available 


## Collection Maintenance Page  
This is the page where one can delete and add collections, as well as
modify the properties
associated with a collection, currently the description and the port.

## Mountebank JSON Page</div>   
This page provides a read only display of the JSON that can be posted to 
Mountebank's imposters endpoint. Additionally one can post directly to
mountebank via a form. Provide the base url to mountebank, and choose the
action, either post or delete. Note that Mountebank will need the '--allowCORS'
option for this to work.

## Persistence 
All data is persisted to local storage. If accessing this application
for the first time, an initial collection will be created. Currently, there
is no facility for downloading or reloading data. The persisted data is in a format
which allows the creation of the Mountebank data, it is not in the 
Mountebank format.
